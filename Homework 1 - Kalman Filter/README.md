1. Run PR_1Final.py to obtain results for Part 1. Prediction

Running this file will give you the mean and covariance at t = 1,2,...,5. 
It will also give you a plot of the joint posterior over the position and velocity, as well as the uncertainty ellipses. 

2. Run PR_2_2Final.py to obtain results for 2. Prediction
Running this file will give the parameters of the Gaussian estimate before and after incorporating the measurement

3. Run PR_2_3Final.py to obtain results for 2. Prediction
